While racial disparities in inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) incidence are fairly well documented, with black women having significantly higher rates compared to white women; less is known about whether IBC prognosis differs by race/ethnicity. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess racial/ethnic disparities in survival among women diagnosed with IBC in the Michigan Cancer Surveillance Program (MCSP) from 1998 to 2014.
