Development of potential therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) required multifaceted strategy considering the high level of complexities of human brain and its mode of function. Here, we adopted an advanced strategy targeting two key pathological hallmarks of AD such as senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangles. We derived a lead short tetrapeptide Ser-Leu-Lys-Pro (SLKP) from dodeca-neuropeptide of amphibian (frog) brain. Results suggest that SLKP peptide has superior effect compared to the dodecapeptide in neuroprotection. This result encourages us to adopt peptidomimetic approach to synthesize SLKP peptoid. Remarkably, we found that SLKP peptoid is more potent than its peptide analogue, which significantly inhibits Aβ fibrillization, moderately binds with tubulin and promotes tubulin polymerization as well as stabilization of microtubule networks. Further, we found that SLKP peptoid is stable in serum, showed significant neuroprotection against Aβ mediated toxicity, promotes significant neurite outgrowth, maintains healthy morphology of rat primary cortical neurons and crosses the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB). To the best of our knowledge our SLKP peptoid is the first shortest peptoid showed significant neuroprotection, neuro-regeneration against Aβ toxicity as well as crossed the BBB offering a potential lead for AD therapeutics.
