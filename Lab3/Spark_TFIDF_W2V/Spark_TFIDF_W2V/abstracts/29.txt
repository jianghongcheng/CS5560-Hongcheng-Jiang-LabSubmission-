APS is an autoimmune disease in which antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) cause vascular thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. In patients with APS, aPL exert pathogenic actions by binding serum beta-2-glycoprotein I (Î²2GPI) via its N-terminal domain I (DI). We previously showed that bacterially-expressed recombinant DI inhibits biological actions of IgG derived from serum of patients with APS (APS-IgG). DI is too small (7 kDa) to be a viable therapeutic agent. Addition of polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) to small molecules enhances the serum half-life, reduces proteolytic targeting and can decrease immunogenicity. It is a common method of tailoring pharmacokinetic parameters and has been used in the production of many therapies in the clinic. However, PEGylation of molecules may reduce their biological activity, and the size of the PEG group can alter the balance between activity and half-life extension. Here we achieve production of site-specific PEGylation of recombinant DI (PEG-DI) and describe the activities
