Despite the constant development of innovative therapeutic options for hematological malignancies, the gold-standard therapy regimen for curative treatment often includes allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The graft-vs.-leukemia effect (GVL) is one of the main therapeutic goals that arises from HSCT. On the other hand, graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) is still one of the main and most serious complications following allogeneic HSCT. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), HSCT together with high-dose chemotherapy is used as a treatment option. An aggressive progression of the disease, a decreased response to treatment, and a poor prognosis are connected to internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the Fms like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene, which affects around 30% of AML patients. In this study, C3H/HeN mice received an allogeneic graft together with 32D-FLT3
