Several humans' diseases such as; cancer, heart disease, diabetes retain an etiology of epigenetic, and a new therapeutic option termed as "epigenetic therapy" can offer a potential way to treat these diseases. A numbers of epigenetic agents such as; inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) have grew an intensive investigation, and many of these agents are currently being tested in a clinical trial, while some of them have been approved for the use by the authorities. Since miRNAs can act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes, the miRNA mimics and molecules targeted at miRNAs (antimiRs) have been designed to treat some of the diseases. Much naturally occurring nutrition were discovered to alter the epigenetic states of cells. The nutrition, including polyphenol, flavonoid compounds, and cruciferous vegetables possess multiple beneficial effects, and some can simultaneously change the DNA methylation, histone modifications and expression of microRNA (miRNA). This review mainly summarizes the information of epigenetic agents of DNMTs and HDACs inhibitors, miRNA mimics and antimiRs, as well as the natural nutrition. In addition, some future perspectives related to the epigenetic therapy are also included.
