We report a case of a 51-year-old man with limbic encephalitis (LE) associated with antibodies against the ¦Á-Amino-3-Hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-Isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR). The patient presented with anterograde memory loss for 2 months. Cranial magnetic resonance and electroencephalogram were normal. AMPAR antibodies were found in blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid. All other test results were unremarkable. CT scans found a tumor in the right lobus superior pulmonis. A CT-guided needle biopsy was performed and pathological results showed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The patient was diagnosed with LE associated with AMPAR antibodies and SCLC. Three months after immunotherapy and tumor removal, patient's memory was partially restored. We recommend that AMPAR antibodies should be detected in patients with classic LE with or without tumor. Prompt treatment of the tumor and immunotherapy are important.
