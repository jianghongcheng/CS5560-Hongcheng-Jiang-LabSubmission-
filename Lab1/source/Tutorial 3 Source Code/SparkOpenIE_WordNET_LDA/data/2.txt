The malignant biological behavior of gastric cancer(GC) is not only determined by cancer cells alone, but also closely regulated by the microenvironment. Fibroblasts represent a large proportion of the components in the tumor microenvironment, and they promote the development of disease. Currently, accumulating evidence suggests that exosomes can function as intercellular transport systems to relay their contents, especially microRNAs(miRNAs).
