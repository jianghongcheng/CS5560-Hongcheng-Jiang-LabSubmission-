mTOR pathway inhibitors such as rapalogs represent a promising tool to induce functional memory CD8 T cells. In this study, we investigated the combination of temsirolimus with anticancer vaccines. Using various designs of cancer vaccines (short and long peptides or the B subunit of Shiga toxin as an antigen delivery vector) and tumor models (melanoma, lung and colon cancer), we showed that the administration of temsirolimus efficiently decreased tumor growth and enhanced tumor-specific CD8 T-cell responses induced by vaccination. Furthermore, tumor-specific CD8 T cells induced by the bi-therapy (vaccine + temsirolimus) exhibit phenotypic characteristics of central memory (CD127
